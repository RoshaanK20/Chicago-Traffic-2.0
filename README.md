üö¶ Chicago Traffic Congestion Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses real-world data from the **City of Chicago** to analyze and predict traffic congestion levels based on time and region using **Machine Learning** models.  
Originally built in my **3rd semester** as part of my BS in Artificial Intelligence program, and now improved in my **4th semester** with better accuracy, visuals, and cleaner code.

## üìä Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict congestion levels (Low, Medium, High) using features like hour of day and region.  
- **Dataset:** [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions](https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - Python  
  - Pandas, NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn

## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Cleaned and processed raw CSV data.  
- Extracted hour information from timestamps.  
- Encoded categorical region values using one-hot encoding.  
- Created a new target feature **CongestionLevel** based on current speed.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
Two ML pipelines were built:
- **Classification Model:** Predicts congestion level (Low, Medium, High)  
  - Algorithm: `RandomForestClassifier`
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Regression Model:** Predicts the current traffic speed  
  - Algorithm: `LinearRegression`
  - Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R¬≤ Score

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- Achieved strong accuracy in congestion classification.  
- Visualized results using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Residual Error Plots
  - Feature Importance Chart

## üìà Key Results
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Classification Accuracy | ~90% (balanced) |
| R¬≤ Score (Regression) | ~0.85 |
| MAE | Low error margin |

*(Values may vary depending on data refresh.)*
